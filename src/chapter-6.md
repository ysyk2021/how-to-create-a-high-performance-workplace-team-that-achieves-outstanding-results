Leadership sets the tone for the entire organization and has a significant impact on the success of the team. Effective leaders prioritize teamwork, communicate openly and honestly, promote trust and respect among team members, and lead by example.

They also prioritize performance management, setting clear goals and expectations, providing regular feedback and coaching, and recognizing and rewarding outstanding performance.

There are several different leadership styles that can be effective for managing high-performance teams. These include:

* Transformational leadership, which involves inspiring and motivating team members to achieve their best work
* Servant leadership, which focuses on serving the needs of the team and helping team members reach their full potential
* Situational leadership, which involves adapting leadership style to fit specific situations or individuals
* Democratic leadership, which involves actively involving team members in decision-making and problem-solving processes

The most effective leadership style will depend on the specific needs and goals of the team.
